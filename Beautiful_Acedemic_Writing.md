# Introduction

**🚩用于形容AI技术/时代的花里胡哨的表达：**
- During the last decade, we have `witnessed` an `unprecedented explosion` of academic and popular interests in machine learning. 
- Deep learning has changed the `landscape` of image registration.
  

**🚩 吸引/激发/强调+注意(attention)/兴趣(interest)：**
- Crowdsourcing has `garnered` widespread interest.
- This has, in turn, `fueled` considerable interest in statistical modeling for location-referenced spatial data.
- The increased availability of labeled X-ray image archives (e.g. ChestX-ray14 dataset) has `triggered` a growing interest in deep learning techniques.
- As remarked in the previous section, we will `address` our attention to the second-order stationary processes. 
  





# Methodology

**🚩satisfy a condition/assumption/structure/...**
- `admit` 替换 `satisfy`：*The original ordering may not `admit` a property/structure/condition.*
- `accomodate` 近似替换 `satisfy`：*To `accommodate` a flexible correlation structure for our model, this article proposes a new multivariate logistic density.*
- `respect` 替换 `satisfy`：*All the above assumptions are `respected` by most of the popular kernels, in particular the Gaussian, Exponential, Uniform, Triangular, Cosine kernel, etc.*
