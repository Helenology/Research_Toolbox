# Introduction

**🚩用于形容AI技术/时代的花里胡哨的表达：**
- During the last decade, we have `witnessed` an `unprecedented explosion` of academic and popular interests in machine learning. 
- Deep learning has changed the `landscape` of image registration.
  

**🚩 吸引/激发/强调+注意(attention)/兴趣(interest)：**
- Crowdsourcing has `garnered` widespread interest.
- This has, in turn, `fueled` considerable interest in statistical modeling for location-referenced spatial data.
- The increased availability of labeled X-ray image archives (e.g. ChestX-ray14 dataset) has `triggered` a growing interest in deep learning techniques.
- As remarked in the previous section, we will `address` our attention to the second-order stationary processes. 
  


# Literature

**🚩 总起介绍前人的工作：**
- The limited scalability of interior point methods has `inspired a recent ﬂurry of work` on ﬁrst-order methods.
- `A line of recent research pursues` calculation of principal components under error minimization.


**🚩 批评前人的工作：**
- PCA is arguably the most widely used statistical tool for data analysis and dimensionality reduction today. However, its brittleness with respect to grossly corrupted observations often `puts its validity in jeopardy` – a single grossly corrupted entry in M could render the estimated L arbitrarily far from the true L0.


# Methodology

**🚩satisfy a condition/assumption/structure/...**
- `admit` 替换 `satisfy`：*The original ordering may not `admit` a property/structure/condition.*
- `accomodate` 近似替换 `satisfy`：*To `accommodate` a flexible correlation structure for our model, this article proposes a new multivariate logistic density.*
- `respect` 替换 `satisfy`：*All the above assumptions are `respected` by most of the popular kernels, in particular the Gaussian, Exponential, Uniform, Triangular, Cosine kernel, etc.*

# Experiments

# Reference

- 英文标题自动大小写：https://www.wordpressleaf.com/capitalize-title
  > 一般从谷歌学术上复制bibtex，但是参考文献的文章标题大小写往往风格不同，可能全部大写，全部小写，首字母大写等等，这个时候需要手动调整，可以把标题复制到这个网站上自动首字母大写

- 画图采用R里最朴素的`plot`和`boxplot`即可，使用灰色色调，如果使用花里胡哨的颜色可能会在交版面费的时候多交💰500😭
