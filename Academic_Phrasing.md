# Introduction

**🚩用于形容AI技术/时代的花里胡哨的表达：**
- During the last decade, we have `witnessed` an `unprecedented explosion` of academic and popular interests in machine learning. 
- Deep learning has changed the `landscape` of image registration.
  

**🚩 吸引/激发/强调+注意(attention)/兴趣(interest)：**
- Crowdsourcing has `garnered` widespread interest.
- This has, in turn, `fueled` considerable interest in statistical modeling for location-referenced spatial data.
- The increased availability of labeled X-ray image archives (e.g. ChestX-ray14 dataset) has `triggered` a growing interest in deep learning techniques.
- As remarked in the previous section, we will `address` our attention to the second-order stationary processes. 
  
**🚩 介绍本文内容：**
- The objective of this work is `twofold`. First, XXX. Second, XXX.
- The framework `encompasses` both XXX and XXX.


# Literature

**🚩 总起介绍前人的工作：**
- The limited scalability of interior point methods has `inspired a recent ﬂurry of work` on ﬁrst-order methods.
- `A line of recent research pursues` calculation of principal components under error minimization.
- As shown in Fig. 1, `a wealth of research is dedicated to` the applications of diffusion models in diverse medical imaging scenarios.
- Since diffusion models have recently received significant attention from the research community, the literature is experiencing `a large influx of` contributions in this direction.
- In recent years, a `flourishing line of research` addresses the very high-dimensional regime.

**🚩 批评前人的工作：**
- PCA is arguably the most widely used statistical tool for data analysis and dimensionality reduction today. However, its brittleness with respect to grossly corrupted observations often `puts its validity in jeopardy` – a single grossly corrupted entry in M could render the estimated L arbitrarily far from the true L0.

**🚩 吹捧自己的工作：**
- The data augmentation step makes the procedure `immune to overfitting`, so that the resulting prediction...
- This extension is substantial in both methodology and applications.
- Our approach `features` a one-stage continuous optimization-based implementation.

# Methodology

**🚩satisfy a condition/assumption/structure/...**
- `admit` 替换 `satisfy`：*The original ordering may not `admit` a property/structure/condition.*
- `accomodate` 近似替换 `satisfy`：*To `accommodate` a flexible correlation structure for our model, this article proposes a new multivariate logistic density.*
- `respect` 替换 `satisfy`：*All the above assumptions are `respected` by most of the popular kernels, in particular the Gaussian, Exponential, Uniform, Triangular, Cosine kernel, etc.*

**🚩 全篇固定一个写法/定义/说明**
- Here and in the following we use the convention $0/0=0$.
- Throughout this paper, unless otherwise stated, $\|\cdot\|$ represents the $\ell_2$ norm of a vector and a matrix. We will use $C$ and $C_i$ to denote positive constants independent of $(n_k , K, N )$.
- Constants $c$, $C$, $c_1$, $\cdots$ are understood to be independent of $n$.
- From now on, we will always denote various positive absolute constants by $C$, $c$, $C_1$, $c_1$ without saying this explicitly.
- We use “const” to symbolize a constant that does not depend on the model parameter $\theta$ and hence does not affect optimization.
- Here and throughout, $T$, when used as a superscript, denotes matrix transposition.

**🚩 需要提前使用一个之后再定义的符号**

- $\mu$ is the xxx parameter, `which will be formally defined later` in Assumption 1.
- For example, `as is shown below`, the function which minimizes the $L_2$ risk can be derived explicitly.
  

**🚩 需要简化符号**
- Here, $m_n(x) = m_n(x, D_n)$ is a measurable function of $x$ and the data. For simplicity, we will `suppress $D_n$ in the notation` and write $m_n(x)$ instead of $m_n(x, D_n)$.
- `For the ease of exposition`, we assume an equal sample size $m_i = m$.
- Let $g(u)$ and $f(u)$ be `a shorthand of` $g_\eta(u)$ and $f_\eta(u)$, respectively.


**🚩 举出直观的例子**
- In order to `build some intuition`
- This notion is best understood by `working through some illustrative examples`.
- As a `follow-up` to the previous example


**🚩 需要节省篇幅**
- `For space consideration`, we present XXX in the supplementary materials.

# Reference

- 英文标题自动大小写：https://www.wordpressleaf.com/capitalize-title
  > 一般从谷歌学术上复制bibtex，但是参考文献的文章标题大小写往往风格不同，可能全部大写，全部小写，首字母大写等等，这个时候需要手动调整，可以把标题复制到这个网站上自动首字母大写

- 画图采用R里最朴素的`plot`和`boxplot`即可，使用灰色色调，如果使用花里胡哨的颜色可能会在交版面费的时候多交💰500😭
